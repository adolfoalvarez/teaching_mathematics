(Static documents)\n- Steep learning curve\n- Complex tag system.\n\n[^1]: Brischoux, F., & Legagneux, P. (2009). Don’t format manuscripts. The Scientist, 23(7), 24.\n\n## Software for academic writing\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"65%\"}\n- Most of us started with word processors (Ms Word, Libreoffice,... )\n  - Formatted text\n\n- LaTeX is the standard in academia\n  - Plain text with markup tagging (i.e. `\\textbf{Bold text}`)\n\n- Markdown\n  - Plain text with lightweight markup tagging (i.e. `**text**`)\n\n- Markdown flavours \n  - i.e. Pandoc for extended features such as tables, figures, quotes\n\n> A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. – John Gruber\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"35%\"}\n  ![Word toolbar](img/word.png)\n:::\n\n::::\n\n## What is Quarto\n\nQuarto is an authoring tool that:\n\n- Support for equations\n- Elegant typesetting\n- Use the same tool for producing slides or articles\n\n. . .\n\nand...\n\n- Uses a simpler markup tag language (Pandoc), \n- Expand the possible outputs not only to PDF but also HTML, Powerpoint, Word, or other formats. \n- Integration with programming languages such as R, Python, or Julia.\n- Calculations and plots can be automatically generated inside the slides or documents, reducing errors and increasing reproducibility. \n- Accesible via your favorite text editor or Jupyter notebooks.\n\n# Starting with Quarto\n\n## Composing the document\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"48%\"}\n- As in LaTeX, you can create a Quarto file (.qmd) in any text editor.\n- But there are editors which are nicely integrated with Quarto: RStudio, VSCode, and Jupyter notebooks.\n- In this text file you write your document using the Pandoc notation.\n- At the beginning of the document we have to specify some basic information.\n\n````markdown\n---\ntitle: \"Introduction to functions\"\nauthor: \"Adolfo Alvarez\"\ndate: '2023-11-06'\nformat:\n  revealjs:\n    theme: mytheme.scss\n    width: 1920\n    height: 1080\n    logo: img/logo.png\n    slide-number: true\n  #docx: default\n  # pdf:\n  #   keep-tex: true\n---\n````\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"4%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"48%\"}\nPossible outputs: \n\n- Documents:\n  - HTML, PDF, Word, OpenOffice, ePub.\n\n- Presentations:\n  - Revealjs, PowerPoint, Beamer.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Pandoc notation\n\nYou can use inline format for text:\n\n- Italic with `_text_` or `*text*`: *Italic text*\n- Bold with `**text**`: **Bold text**\n- Hyperlinks with `[text](link)`, e.g., [XX OKNMUT](https://oknmut.umg.edu.pl/).\n- Images with `![Alternative text](Path/to/image)`\n\n![XX OKNMUT](img/logo.png). \n\n\n## Pandoc notation\n\n- Section headers can be written after a number of pound signs, e.g.,\n\n```markdown\n# First-level header\n\n## Second-level header\n\n### Third-level header\n```\n\nIn slide mode `#` will open a new slide separator, `##` a new slide, and `###` a subtitle\n\n\n## Lists \n\nUnordered list items start with `*`, `-`, or `+`, and you can nest one list within another list by indenting the sub-list, e.g.,\n\n```markdown\n- one item\n* one item\n+ one item\n    - one more item\n    - one more item\n    - one more item\n```\n\nThe output is:\n\n- one item\n* one item\n+ one item\n    - one more item\n    - one more item\n    - one more item\n\n## Lists \n\nOrdered list items start with numbers (you can also nest lists within lists), e.g.,\n\n```markdown\n1. the first item\n2. the second item\n3. the third item\n    - one unordered item\n    - one unordered item\n```\n\nThe output does not look too much different with the Pandoc source:\n\n1. the first item\n2. the second item\n3. the third item\n    - one unordered item\n    - one unordered item\n\n## Quotes \n\nBlockquotes are written after `>`, e.g.,\n\n```markdown\n> \"I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me, \n> I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand \n> and lead him to a quiet place and kill him.\"\n>\n> --- Mark Twain\n```\n\n> \"I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me,\n  I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him\n  to a quiet place and kill him.\"\n>\n> --- Mark Twain\n\n## Columns \n  \nWe can arrange content into columns of varying widths:\n\n```markdown\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"35%\"}\nThis is column 1\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"3%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"62%\"}\nThis is column 2\n:::\n:::\n```\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"35%\"}\nThis is column 1\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"3%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"62%\"}\nThis is column 2\n:::\n:::\n\n## Formulas\n\n- Equations can be written using LaTeX notation \n- Inline equations should be enclosed into dollar signs:\n  - You write `$\\int_{1}^{x}(2-u^2)du$`\n  - You get $\\int_{1}^{x}(2-u^2)du$\n- Display style should be enclosed into double dollar signs:\n  - You write ` $$\\int_{1}^{x}(2-u^2)du$$ `\n  - You get $$\\int_{1}^{x}(2-u^2)du$$\n  \n\n\n  \n## Example\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"49%\"}\n```` markdown\n---\ntitle: \"Exam logic and set theory\"\nauthor: \"Anna Szczepańska-Álvarez\"\nformat: pdf\n---\n\n1.

characterized in many ways. It is the base of a logarithm of natural logarithms. It is the Limit of a sequence of $(1 + 1/n)^n$ as $n$ approaches infinity, an expression that arises in the study of compound interest. It can also be calculated as the sum of the infinite Series\n$$\ne =  \\sum\\limits_{n = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!} = 1 + \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1\\cdot 2} + \\frac{1}{1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3} + \\cdots \n$$\n\n::: {.notes}\nLeonhard Euler was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, geographer, logician, and engineer who founded the studies of graph theory and topology and made pioneering and influential discoveries in many other branches of mathematics such as analytic number theory, complex analysis, and infinitesimal calculus.\n:::\n\n# Conclusions\n\n## Conclusions\n\n::: incremental\n- Quarto is an alternative to LaTeX to produce documents and slides for our lectures.\n- It expands the possible outputs to several formats\n- Considering the use of HTML slides will provide more interactivity to the class.\n- Other uses of Quarto we didn't cover today include journal templates, books, websites, etc.\n:::\n\n. . .\n\nGet more information and trainings material at: [Quarto.org](https://quarto.org){preview-link=\"true\"}\n\n# Thank you!\n\n\n\n",
